# How to Contribute

This is a pretty informal project at the moment.  Here are some ideas about how to contribute:

- via email to me (Frank Sergeant) at pygmy@utoh.org.
- create an issue (click on *Issues*)
- fork the repository and send a pull request

For bugs, please try to show a simple example that illustrates the 
problem and also explain what happens and what *should* happen.

For suggestions for improvement, please explain the idea and why it is a good idea.  
Creating as issue would be helpful.

Feel free to send me email at pygmy@utoh.org for general comments, especially if
creating issues and pull requests is inconvenient for you.
